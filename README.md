# carbon_offsets

Just a fun page to track and host my carbon offsetting/credits.

Also, wanted to test:

1. Some limits to testing `iframes`. For instance, using the Browser-based **Web Inspector** on Desktop will fail to correctly render the changing `iframe src`. However, when deployed to a host, the changes appear correctly.
2. I was unaware that `iframes` could be modified after being rendered. Curious about how the `iframe` and `pdfviewer` interact on the page.
